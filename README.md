    <h2>Tutorial - Text Fill Effect</h2>
</p>
<p>
    The tutorial source code to learn how you can create a text fill effect.  
</p>
<p>
    As with all of the tutorials I create, I aim to support IE 10+, Chrome, Firefox, & Opera. And as always, please feel free to use this code, whether it be just a snippet or the whole thing, in any of your projects commercial or personal. I don't want to hold any of the code ransom here.
